# User Journey & Activation Model

## The Core Challenge

Charitable needs to take someone from "I've never heard of this" to "I just donated to a Denver nonprofit" to "I give monthly and check my giving history." The funnel has three distinct problems:

1. **Awareness** — How do they find Charitable?
2. **Activation** — What makes them donate the first time?
3. **Retention** — What brings them back and converts them to recurring?

Each stage has different mechanics, and the Denver MVP creates both constraints and advantages.

---

## Stage 1: Acquisition — How People Find Charitable

### The Denver advantage

Denver is one of the best US cities for this MVP. Colorado Gives Day alone raised $56.6M in 2024 from 670,000+ lifetime donors through ColoradoGives.org. The culture of local giving already exists — Charitable doesn't need to create it, just capture and improve it. Capitol Hill, RiNo, and LoDo are the three densest young-professional neighborhoods, with the 25–39 age group overrepresented in Capitol Hill and Five Points specifically.

### Channel strategy (ranked by likely ROI for a zero/low-budget MVP)

#### Tier 1: Free, high-signal channels

**1. Denver subreddit and local online communities**
r/Denver is one of the most active city subreddits. A genuine post about "I built a tool to help Denverites find and support local nonprofits" — not an ad, but a real conversation — can generate meaningful early traffic. The key is being a community member first. Same applies to Denver-specific Facebook groups, Nextdoor neighborhoods (Capitol Hill, RiNo, LoDo), and Denver Tech Community Slack/Discord channels.

**2. Colorado Gives Day piggyback (timing: early December)**
This is the single biggest annual moment when Denver residents think about local giving. Charitable should be live and visible before Colorado Gives Day. The play: "Already know who you're supporting on Colorado Gives Day? Track your giving in one place with Charitable." This isn't competing with ColoradoGives — it's complementing it. Position as the year-round home for what Colorado Gives Day starts.

**3. Content SEO — own "Denver nonprofit" search intent**
80% of US consumers search for local businesses online weekly. The search queries "best Denver nonprofits," "where to donate in Denver," "Denver charities for homelessness" are high-intent and underserved by quality content. Most results are listicles from magazines (303 Magazine, Westword) or generic directories. Charitable can own this with genuinely useful, trust-forward charity profiles that rank for these terms. This is a slow channel but compounds over time.

**4. Denver tech meetups and coworking spaces**
The primary audience is urban professionals under 40, many in tech. Denver Tech Meetup, Denver Tech On Tap, 1 Million Cups, and Denver Startup Week are all free or cheap to attend. A 60-second demo at a meetup, or even just stickers on laptops at a coworking space (the Reddit playbook — $500 in stickers drove massive awareness), gets Charitable in front of the exact right people. Commons on Champa is a free coworking space that would be a natural starting point.

#### Tier 2: Low-cost, high-creativity channels

**5. Partnership with 1–3 Denver nonprofits at launch**
Find 2–3 local nonprofits that are small, impactful, and hard to discover — exactly the kind Charitable is designed to surface. Partner with them before launch: "We're featuring you on our platform and driving donors your way." They promote Charitable to their existing supporters; Charitable gives them visibility they couldn't get alone. This creates a two-sided acquisition loop: nonprofits bring their audience, Charitable brings new donors to the nonprofits.

**6. "Denver Giving Guide" as a standalone content piece**
Create a shareable, opinionated guide: "10 Denver Nonprofits You've Never Heard Of (And Why They're Worth Your Money)." This is not a generic listicle — each entry includes why the org is credible, what your money actually does, and a direct donate link through Charitable. Publish on the Charitable blog, share on Denver subreddits and social, pitch to 303 Magazine or Denverite for a feature. This single piece of content can be the top-of-funnel engine for months.

**7. Nextdoor as a hyperlocal channel**
Nextdoor has 100M+ users across 345,000 neighborhoods. 9 out of 10 neighbors surveyed said they planned to help others in December. Mentions of donations and charities increased 98% YoY on the platform during the pandemic. Charitable could create a business page, encourage early users to post recommendations, and eventually run neighborhood-targeted ads. The trust layer (verified addresses) aligns with Charitable's "local and trusted" positioning.

**8. Hyperlocal influencer partnerships**
Not Instagram celebrities — Denver-specific food bloggers, neighborhood Instagram accounts (@rinoartdistrict, etc.), local journalists. Hyperlocal influencers have smaller but deeply engaged, geographically concentrated audiences and achieve significantly higher engagement and conversion than mainstream influencer campaigns. A single post from a well-followed Denver account ("I've been using this app to track my giving to Denver nonprofits") is worth more than paid ads.

#### Tier 3: Paid / event-based (when ready to scale)

**9. Geo-fenced digital ads**
Meta and Google both allow geo-targeting down to specific ZIP codes. Run ads only in 80202 (LoDo), 80205 (RiNo/Five Points), 80203 (Capitol Hill) — the three densest young-professional neighborhoods. This keeps ad spend minimal while reaching exactly the right people. Creative should be local: "Your neighbors in Cap Hill support [nonprofit name]. See who else is making Denver better."

**10. Denver Startup Week / B-Cycle / farmers market presence**
Physical presence at community events. Not a booth with a banner — something interactive. Ideas: a physical "giving wall" where people write which Denver cause matters most to them, with a QR code to find and support that cause on Charitable. Or partner with Denver B-Cycle (bike share) for a "ride and give" campaign.

#### The unconventional plays

**11. "Give Where You Live" sticker/coaster campaign**
Print stickers or bar coasters with "Give Where You Live — charitable.app" and a QR code. Distribute to breweries and coffee shops in RiNo, LoDo, and Cap Hill. Denver's brewery density is among the highest in the US. A coaster sitting in front of someone for 45 minutes at a brewery is more attention than any digital ad will get. Cost: ~$200 for 1,000 coasters.

**12. Annual giving receipt / year-in-review**
Time this for late December / early January. Every Charitable user gets a shareable "2026 Giving Wrapped" — a visual summary of their giving for the year (total donated, causes supported, charities helped). Designed to be shared on social media. This turns existing users into acquisition engines. Spotify Wrapped generates massive organic sharing; a giving version taps into the same psychology (identity expression) with the added benefit that sharing generosity is socially rewarded, not seen as bragging.

**13. New Year's resolution timing (January launch window)**
Counterintuitive: most giving products launch for the holiday giving season (November/December). But that's when competition for attention is highest. January is a giving slump — but it's a _resolution_ peak. "This year, give better" hits differently on January 2nd than December 15th. A January launch positions Charitable as a fresh-start tool, not a holiday guilt trip. This aligns perfectly with the "calm, not urgent" design principle.

---

## Stage 2: First-Use Experience — From Landing to First Donation

### The critical first session

The user has arrived (from a Reddit post, a friend's share, a Google search for "Denver nonprofits"). They have about 60 seconds of attention. What needs to happen:

### Proposed first-session flow

1. **Landing page** — Immediate clarity: "Discover trusted Denver nonprofits and start giving better." No signup wall. No feature tour. Show real charities immediately.

2. **Browse without signup** — Let them explore charities right away. Each charity card shows: name, one-line mission, cause tags, and a trust indicator (e.g., "Verified 501(c)(3) · Active since 2015 · 90%+ program spend"). This is the trust-over-hype principle in action.

3. **Charity detail page** — The trust explanation layer. Not just a Charity Navigator score — a human-readable explanation of why this org is credible, what your money does, and what impact looks like. This is Charitable's core differentiator and it needs to be visible before any donation happens.

4. **Donate button** — Every.org widget opens in a modal. Frequency toggle (one-time / monthly) is visible. No account required for the first donation.

5. **Post-donation prompt** — "Want to track this donation and see your giving over time? Create a free account." This is the signup moment — after value is delivered, not before. The account unlocks giving history, recurring status tracking, and future charity recommendations.

### What this means for the activation metric

The **activation moment** is the first completed donation, not the account creation. A user who donates but doesn't create an account has still activated — they experienced the core value. The account is a retention mechanism, not an activation gate.

Secondary activation signals (for users who browse but don't donate):
- Browsing 3+ charity profiles in a session (shows intent)
- Bookmarking or saving a charity (if that feature exists)
- Sharing a charity profile

---

## Stage 3: The Second Donation — The Most Important Moment

### Why the second gift matters more than the first

This is the single most important insight from donor retention research:

- Only **20% of first-time donors** give again
- **60% of second-time donors** continue giving
- Monthly donors retain at **90%**
- The cost to replace a lost donor is **5x** the cost of retaining one
- The recapture rate for lapsed donors is just **4%**

This means Charitable's entire retention strategy should be optimized for converting the first donation into a second one. Everything else (giving history, recurring tracking, year-in-review) is secondary to this one transition.

### How to drive the second donation

**1. 30-day "Proof of Progress" message**
Within 30 days of the first donation, send a message showing what the charity accomplished recently. Not "thanks for donating" — that's a receipt. Instead: "[Charity name] served 450 meals last month in Five Points. You're part of that." This reframes the donation from a transaction into participation.

**2. Related charity suggestion**
"You supported [food bank]. People who give to [food bank] also support [youth mentoring program]." This is the Netflix recommendation model applied to giving. It lowers the decision cost of the second donation — the user doesn't have to discover a new charity from scratch.

**3. Monthly prompt for one-time donors**
If the first donation was one-time, send a gentle prompt after 30 days: "Your one-time gift to [charity] made a difference. Want to make it monthly? Even $10/month adds up to $120 this year." This is the critical conversion point from one-time to recurring.

**4. Colorado Gives Day as a re-engagement hook**
For users who donated once earlier in the year, Colorado Gives Day (December) is a natural re-engagement moment: "Last time you supported [charity]. Colorado Gives Day is Tuesday — want to give again?" This leverages an existing cultural moment rather than manufacturing urgency.

---

## Stage 4: Retention — What Brings People Back

### Ongoing engagement triggers

Once a user has donated twice, the retention dynamics shift. They're now a repeat donor with 60%+ likelihood of continuing. The goal is to make Charitable the default "home" for their giving, not just a donation widget.

**1. Giving history as the core retention surface**
The giving history page is not a feature — it's the product. It's the answer to "What have I actually supported?" that no other tool provides. Every time a user returns to check their giving history, they're reinforcing the habit. Design it to feel like a personal financial dashboard, not a list of receipts.

**2. Recurring donation confirmation (monthly webhook)**
Each month, when the Every.org webhook fires for a recurring donation, surface this to the user: "Your monthly gift to [charity] was charged on [date]. You've given $X total this year." This is both a retention signal (the system is working) and a pride trigger (look what I've done).

**3. Inactive recurring detection**
When a recurring donation goes 35+ days without a webhook (likely cancelled on Every.org), show the gray "No recent activity" indicator. This is actually a retention moment: "Your monthly gift to [charity] may have lapsed. Manage on Every.org or start a new monthly gift." Honest, not manipulative — but still an action prompt.

**4. Quarterly or annual giving summary**
A periodic summary (email or in-app) showing total given, charities supported, and causes covered. The year-end version is the shareable "Giving Wrapped" that doubles as an acquisition tool (see Stage 1). The quarterly version is lighter: "Q1 2026: You supported 3 Denver nonprofits totaling $85."

**5. New charity discovery based on giving patterns**
As the charity database grows, recommend new charities based on what the user already supports. "You give to organizations focused on youth education. Have you seen [new charity]?" This gives users a reason to return even when they're not checking their giving history.

### What NOT to build for retention

Aligned with the "calm, respectful UX" design principle, Charitable should explicitly avoid:

- Leaderboards or social comparison ("You're in the top 10% of givers!")
- Streak mechanics ("You've donated 3 months in a row — don't break your streak!")
- Guilt-based re-engagement ("It's been 2 months since your last donation...")
- Push notifications about other people's donations
- Gamification badges or points

These work in the short term but undermine the "measured, personal financial behavior" positioning. The retention model should feel like a budgeting app (calm, informative, always there when you want it) rather than a fitness app (pushing you to do more).

---

## Stage 5: One-Time to Recurring — The Conversion Path

### Why recurring matters

- Monthly donors give **42% more per year** than one-time donors
- Monthly donations accounted for **31% of all online nonprofit revenue** in 2024, up 5% YoY
- Monthly donor retention rate is **90%** vs. 23% for first-time one-time donors

### The conversion journey

**Step 1: First donation is one-time** (default behavior — don't fight it)
Most users will make their first donation as a one-time gift. This is normal. The Every.org widget shows both options (one-time and monthly), but don't default to monthly or push it aggressively on the first donation. Let the user set the terms.

**Step 2: Post-donation, show the monthly math**
On the confirmation screen or in the follow-up message: "Your $25 one-time gift helps [charity]. A monthly gift of $10 would add up to $120 this year — that's [tangible impact statement]." Frame it as information, not pressure.

**Step 3: Re-engagement at 30 days**
The "Proof of Progress" message (Stage 3) ends with a soft monthly ask. This is the highest-leverage moment for conversion.

**Step 4: Colorado Gives Day conversion**
For one-time donors approaching December: "You gave once to [charity] this year. Want to make it monthly starting on Colorado Gives Day?" This ties the conversion to a meaningful cultural moment rather than an arbitrary date.

**Step 5: "Give Monthly" variant on the donate button**
For charity pages, offer a secondary CTA: "Give Monthly" alongside the default "Donate" button. This uses Every.org's Donate Link with `frequency=MONTHLY` pre-set. Don't hide the one-time option — just make monthly equally visible.

### What "converting to recurring" actually looks like technically

Charitable doesn't manage subscriptions — Every.org does. The "conversion" is really about guiding the user to choose "Monthly" in the Every.org widget rather than "One-time." After that, Every.org handles billing, and Charitable receives a webhook each month confirming the charge. The conversion happens in the UX and messaging, not in the backend.

## Denver MVP Launch Playbook — Putting It Together

### Phase 1: Pre-launch (4–6 weeks before go-live)

- Curate the initial charity set: 20–30 Denver nonprofits across 4–5 cause areas (homelessness, food security, youth education, environment, mental health)
- Write trust explanations for each charity
- Partner with 2–3 of the smallest/least-visible nonprofits for launch co-promotion
- Set up Nextdoor business page, claim Google Business Profile
- Write the "Denver Giving Guide" content piece
- Design and order coasters/stickers for brewery distribution

### Phase 2: Soft launch (2–4 weeks)

- Post on r/Denver and Denver Facebook groups (genuine, conversational)
- Distribute coasters to 10–15 breweries/coffee shops in Cap Hill, RiNo, LoDo
- Share the Denver Giving Guide on social channels
- Attend 2–3 Denver tech meetups with a quick demo
- Email the partner nonprofits' lists announcing Charitable

### Phase 3: Colorado Gives Day push (December)

- "Track your Colorado Gives Day donations in one place" campaign
- Re-engage all existing users with charity recommendations
- Shareable "Colorado Gives Day + Charitable" content for social
- This is the single biggest awareness moment of the year — be ready

### Phase 4: Year-end / New Year's (late December–January)

- Send "2026 Giving Wrapped" to all users (shareable)
- "New year, new giving habit" positioning for January acquisition
- Convert one-time December donors to recurring in January

### Phase 5: Ongoing

- Monthly content: one new charity spotlight per month
- SEO: continue publishing Denver-specific charity content
- Re-engagement for lapsed users around key moments (Colorado Gives Day, year-end)
- Iterate based on actual activation and retention data

## Metrics to Track

| Stage | Metric | Target (directional) |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | Unique visitors / month | Growth MoM |
| Activation | First donation rate (visitors → donors) | 5–10% |
| Second donation | % of first-time donors who give again within 90 days | 20%+ (matches industry baseline; beating it = product-market fit signal) |
| Recurring conversion | % of one-time donors who switch to monthly within 6 months | 10–15% |
| Retention | Monthly active users returning to giving history | 40%+ of account holders |
| Sharing | % of users who share a charity profile or giving summary | Baseline TBD |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **The real competition is inaction.** Everything in acquisition and activation should lower the barrier to a first donation as close to zero as possible. No signup wall. No feature tour. Charities visible immediately.

2. **The second donation is the whole game.** Allocate more design and engineering effort to the 30-day post-first-donation experience than to any other feature.

3. **Colorado Gives Day is Charitable's Super Bowl.** It's the one moment per year when Denver collectively thinks about local giving. Being live and visible before Colorado Gives Day is the single most important timing decision for the MVP.

4. **Recurring conversion is a UX problem, not a backend problem.** Every.org handles the billing. Charitable's job is to make "monthly" feel natural and show the ongoing impact.

5. **Denver's density and culture are the moat for MVP.** Three neighborhoods, an established giving culture, an active tech community, and a flagship giving day. This is an unusually good testing ground for a local-first product.

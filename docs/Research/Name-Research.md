### 5. Google Brand Noise Check

**Status:** ⚠️ MODERATE NOISE — Existing orgs with similar names (not competitors)

**Existing organizations using "Local Good" in the charity space:**

| Organization | URL | What They Do | Relationship to Us |
|--------------|-----|--------------|-------------------|
| Local Good Philadelphia | localgood.info | 501c3 providing microgrants to people in need | They ARE a charity, not a discovery platform |
| The Local Good Collective | localgood.org | Texas nonprofit running food pantries, education centers | They ARE a charity |
| Local Good Center | localgoodcenter.org | Plano nonprofit, community services | They ARE a charity |
| LocalGood.com | local-good.com | Artist marketplace, 5% to charity | Different model (e-commerce) |
| Local Good Fundraising | localgoodfundraising.com | Fundraising services in Rochester/Syracuse | B2B fundraising services |

**Key concern:** Brand confusion risk — users searching for our platform may find these organizations instead. However, none of these are competitors:
- They're charities themselves, not charity discovery platforms
- Different audiences (people in need vs. values-driven professionals seeking to give)
- Different value propositions

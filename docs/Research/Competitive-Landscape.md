# Competitive Landscape

## How the Target Audience Currently Gives

Before mapping competitors, it's worth understanding what Charitable is actually displacing. The target user — an urban professional under 40 who gives occasionally but wants to give better — currently gives through a fragmented set of channels:

### Current behaviors

1. **Crowdfunding (GoFundMe, Spotfund)** — The default for younger donors. Social-media-driven, peer-to-peer, one-time. 85% of Gen Z would donate if prompted by an online creator. Half of Gen Z shares causes at least weekly. This is the dominant channel, but it's reactive (someone shares a link) rather than intentional (I chose this cause).

2. **Direct to nonprofit websites** — When they do give to an organization, it's usually through the org's own donate page. Receipts end up scattered across email inboxes. No unified view of giving history.

3. **Checkout prompts** — ~40% of US adults donated at a store checkout in 2025. Convenient but not intentional. No connection to values or local impact.

4. **Workplace giving (Millie, Benevity, YourCause)** — Employer-matched programs. Works well for the employed segment, but the donor has little agency over discovery — the employer curates the list.

5. **Not giving at all** — 30% of adults surveyed in late 2025 hadn't donated and didn't plan to. The small-donor segment ($1–$100) dropped 11.1% YoY in early 2025. This is the biggest "competitor" — inaction driven by uncertainty, financial pressure, and lack of a clear reason to give.

### What this tells us

The target user's current giving is **reactive, fragmented, and impersonal**. They give when prompted (a friend's GoFundMe, a checkout screen, a workplace match), not because they've chosen a cause and built a habit. Receipts are scattered. There's no single place that answers "What have I actually supported?"

Charitable is not displacing a specific product. It's displacing **the absence of a system** — the gap between "I'd like to give more thoughtfully" and "I don't have a tool that helps me do that."

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct competitors (platforms a donor might use instead of Charitable)

#### Every.org
- **What it is:** Free nonprofit fundraising platform (itself a 501(c)(3)). Database of 1.5M+ US nonprofits. Accepts cards, bank, stock, crypto, DAFs.
- **Strengths:** Zero platform fees. Handles tax receipts, compliance, state registrations. Embeddable donate widget. Widest payment method support.
- **Weaknesses:** Discovery is functional but not curated — it's a database, not a guide. No local-first lens. Limited integrations (Salesforce only). Support is email-only. No giving history dashboard for donors.
- **Charitable's relationship:** Every.org is Charitable's payment and compliance layer, not its competitor. Charitable adds discovery, curation, trust signals, and a donor-facing giving history on top of Every.org's infrastructure.

#### Daffy
- **What it is:** Consumer donor-advised fund (DAF). Mobile app. $3/month entry tier. 1.7M+ charities. AI-powered "Quick Donate" (natural language: "Give $100 to my local school").
- **Strengths:** Tax-smart giving (contribute stock/crypto, get immediate deduction, donate later). AI discovery. Social features (shareable profiles, campaign creation). Modern UX aimed at younger donors. Recurring giving is native.
- **Weaknesses:** Requires funding a DAF account first — different mental model than "just donate." $3/month minimum for paid features. Not local-first; discovery is broad. The DAF model works best for donors giving $500+/year (tax benefits matter more at that level).
- **Gap Charitable fills:** Daffy is "give smarter with tax optimization." Charitable is "give better in your community." Different entry point, different motivation. Charitable's audience may not yet give enough annually for a DAF to make sense.

#### Charity Navigator
- **What it is:** Nonprofit rating and discovery platform. 225,000+ charities rated. AI search tool. Curated cause-specific funds.
- **Strengths:** Strong brand for trust evaluation. Financial accountability scores, governance ratings, program expense ratios. Curated funds (End Hunger, End Homelessness).
- **Weaknesses:** Evaluation-focused, not action-focused. No integrated donation flow — you research on Charity Navigator, then go elsewhere to donate. No local discovery lens. Ratings feel opaque and institutional (the exact problem Charitable's audience cites). No giving history or continuity features.
- **Gap Charitable fills:** Charity Navigator answers "Is this charity legitimate?" Charitable answers "Which local charities near me are worth supporting, and how do I start giving to them right now?" Charitable could reference Charity Navigator data as one trust signal among others.

#### ColoradoGives.org (Colorado Gives Foundation)
- **What it is:** Statewide platform for Colorado nonprofits. ~4,000 local nonprofits listed. 100,000+ donors. Hosts Colorado Gives Day annually ($56.6M raised in 2024).
- **Strengths:** Already the local giving platform for Colorado. Cause and location filtering. Multiple payment methods (credit card, bank, PayPal, DAF). Fundraiser creation tools.
- **Weaknesses:** Designed for nonprofits first, donors second. Discovery UX is utilitarian — category grids and search filters, not curated recommendations. Built around Colorado Gives Day (one annual event) rather than sustained year-round giving habits. No personalization, no giving history dashboard, no trust explanation layer.
- **Gap Charitable fills:** ColoradoGives is the infrastructure; Charitable is the experience. ColoradoGives answers "Where can I find Colorado nonprofits?" Charitable answers "Which Denver nonprofits should I trust, and how do I build a sustainable giving habit?" A Denver user might use both, but Charitable owns the relationship.

### Adjacent competitors (different model, overlapping audience)

#### GoFundMe
- **What it is:** Crowdfunding platform. $40B+ raised since 2010. Personal and nonprofit campaigns.
- **Strengths:** Massive brand recognition. Zero platform fees. Peer-to-peer virality.
- **Weaknesses:** Optimized for one-time, urgent, viral campaigns — not sustained giving. No nonprofit vetting or trust signals. GoFundMe created 1.4M nonprofit pages from IRS data without consent, eroding trust. No local discovery. No giving history.
- **Gap Charitable fills:** GoFundMe is "help this person right now." Charitable is "support your community over time." Entirely different relationship with the donor.

#### ShareTheMeal (WFP)
- **What it is:** UN World Food Programme donation app. 1.3M+ users. One-tap donations. "Impact loop" with field updates and videos.
- **Strengths:** Best-in-class donor feedback loop (personalized updates from the field, matched to actual families). Calm, beautiful UX. Low-cost entry ($0.80/meal). Monthly subscription ("The Table") with 37,000 members.
- **Weaknesses:** Global hunger only — not local. Single cause. Not a discovery platform.
- **Relevance to Charitable:** ShareTheMeal is a UX benchmark, not a competitor. Its impact loop (donate → see what happened → feel connected → donate again) is the exact pattern Charitable should replicate for local giving. The "Last charged [date]" + charity updates model from Phase 5 is a simplified version of this.

#### GiveGab / Bonterra Giving Days
- **What it is:** Giving Day software for community-wide 24-hour fundraising campaigns. Now owned by Bonterra.
- **Strengths:** Purpose-built for local giving events. Gamification (thermometers, heat maps, real-time tracking). Strong for community foundations and United Ways.
- **Weaknesses:** Event-based, not year-round. Nonprofit-facing (the donor is a participant, not the primary user). Pricing is opaque and enterprise-oriented. Not a consumer product.
- **Gap Charitable fills:** GiveGab powers the annual event. Charitable powers the other 364 days.

#### Millie
- **What it is:** Workplace giving and volunteering platform. Matches employees with 3 nonprofits per week based on location and preferences (dating-app style).
- **Strengths:** Personalized discovery. Donation matching integration. Volunteer tracking. Clean mobile UX.
- **Weaknesses:** B2B model — the employer is the customer, not the individual donor. Requires employer adoption. Corporate-curated, which limits donor agency.
- **Gap Charitable fills:** Millie requires your employer to participate. Charitable is for the individual who wants to give on their own terms.

## What Charitable Displaces vs. Creates Net-New

| | Displaces | Creates net-new |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | Googling "Denver nonprofits," browsing ColoradoGives category grids, relying on word-of-mouth | Curated, trust-explained local charity discovery with a local-first lens |
| **Donation flow** | Going to individual nonprofit websites, scattered checkout processes | Single donate action via Every.org widget, unified across all charities |
| **Giving history** | Searching email for scattered receipts, no unified view | One place to see everything you've supported, with recurring status tracking |
| **Recurring confidence** | Setting up monthly on a nonprofit site with no feedback loop | Active/inactive status indicators, management links, honest uncertainty when status is unclear |
| **Trust evaluation** | Charity Navigator scores (opaque), gut feel, brand recognition | Charity-specific trust explanations: why this org is credible, what they do, where the money goes |

The biggest net-new creation is the **giving history as a personal financial behavior** — no consumer-facing product currently treats charitable giving as a measured, trackable, long-term personal practice the way a budgeting app treats spending. This is the core positioning gap Charitable occupies.

## Key Takeaways for Product Decisions

1. **ColoradoGives.org is the most direct local overlap.** Charitable should not try to replicate its nonprofit directory. Instead, treat it as infrastructure and differentiate on curation, trust explanation, and donor experience.

2. **Daffy is the most sophisticated consumer competitor**, but it targets a different motivation (tax optimization) and a different entry price ($3/month + DAF funding). Charitable's advantage is zero barrier and emotional resonance over financial optimization.

3. **No existing product combines local discovery + trust explanation + giving history + calm UX.** This is the open lane. Each competitor does one or two of these; none do all four.

4. **ShareTheMeal's impact loop is the UX north star.** Donate → see impact → feel connected → donate again. Charitable's version of this (for MVP) is: donate → see it in giving history → get next monthly confirmation → see it still active.

5. **The real competition is inaction.** Small-donor participation is declining 11% YoY. The product needs to make giving feel achievable and worth starting — not just better for people who already give.

*The purpose of this document is to outline any big areas we hope to learn from this MVP and connect it with tracking*

### Learn: Conversion funnel
- What is the conversion / drop-off between critical steps in the flow?
- Measure:
	- What are the total number of unique users who: 
		1. View homepage
		2. View charity page 
		3. Make a donation
		4. Create an account

### Learn: Giving types
- What is the appetite for financial donations compared to donating time?
- Measure: 
	- Button clicks on "Donate" vs "Volunteer"

	- We are biasing the app toward donations, so Donate will be higher. How might we better identify a signal on volunteer?
- Current assumption:
	- Higher desire for financial

### Learn: Donation types
- What is frequency on single donations vs recurring? 
- Measure: 
	- Button clicks on "One-time Donation" vs "Volunteer"
	- OR is it webhooks from every.org on single vs frequency, where INITIAL is yes (to not double / triple count recurring donations?)

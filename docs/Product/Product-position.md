## Problem Space
The following trends exist for Millennials and Gen Z, especially those that work in jobs that combine mindfulness with a lack of human-to-human contact in their daily lives (tech).

1. Desire for stronger community connection
	- People feel frustrated by issues prevalent in their cities and local communities, but they but they lack a clear connection or avenue to participate and uplift their communities.
	- People are frustrated by government spending and ineffectiveness when it comes to solving problems in their community.
	- Increased skepticism about large, opaque nonprofits or fatigue with urgency-driven, trend-based donation appeals
2. Concern about the impact of one's charitable giving
	- National charity rating feels opaque and high-level. It doesn't feel clear how trustworthy or impactful a given charity is.
	- People are curious about the most effective way to truly make an impact in their community (e.g., is it better to help adult homeless, children with single mothers, etc.)
3. Concern about affordability 
	- Although this segment is well-to-do, they are financially conscious and could not imagine donating an amount that significantly hurts their bottom-line (e.g., the way years ago, it was common to donate 10% of income to the church)
	- When they do give, receipts are scattered across inboxes and there’s no single place to understand “What have I actually supported?”
    

The result of these issues is that individual small-time donations are low compared to historical averages. Institutional and ultra-wealthy individual giving is high, and this perpetuates a helpless feeling in which people feel they are not personally making an impact around them (instead, it's their company, or their city's billionaire).

## Solution Space

### What it is
This product is a trusted giving platform that helps people discover local charities they can believe in, donate easily, and track their impact over time.

Rather than pushing people to give more, it helps them give _better_, in a way that feels aligned with their values, helps their neighbors, and is sustainable over time.

It treats giving like a measured, personal financial behavior, not a marketing moment.


Product mission: Remove any friction to make an impact in your community.

### Primary audience 

Values-driven individuals who give occasionally but want to give better, especially:
- Urban or suburban professionals under 40 that do not feel they are making an impact at work
- People the need to care more about their local community

These users feel friction in the following ways:
- Can I afford this?
- Will this actually make an impact? 
- How can I make an impact I can see and feel (e.g., locally around me)
  


Recurring payments

Our Beliefs:
- People know their home best. And they are best suited to make an impact at home.
- proximity builds meaning
- local organizations deserve better discovery tools
- “close to home” is a legitimate giving value
- Local charities are harder to evaluate—but often more impactful to donors’ lived experience.






The app focuses on:

- **Discovery**: surfacing vetted, legitimate charities near you
    
- **Trust**: explaining _why_ each organization is credible
    
- **Ease**: fast, modern donation UX (Apple Pay / card)
    
- **Continuity**: one place to see and understand your giving over time



### What it is not

- It doesn't ask “How do we get people to donate right now?”, it asks “How do we make giving feel confident, human, and sustainable?”
- It is not a fundraising campaign, a viral donation tool, or a marketplace pushing urgency. It is a calm, reliable home for personal giving—starting with local charities.
- It is not about calculating the most optimal or effective altruism on earth (e.g., mosquito nets in another country). Instead, it's about being reasonable and impactful for change you can see, like helping your neighbors down the street. 
- This is **not** optimized for: 
	- One-time viral donations
	- National charities (e.g., Red Cross)
	- Gamified social giving
	- High-pressure fundraising
This is optimized for local charities that:
- Make an impact that can be felt
- Are potentially low-visibility or do not have the resources for exposure





### Risky assumptions:

- People care about this
- People are motivated enough to seek this solution out and actually sign up
	- Is there a marketing strategy that could actually work?
- People will activate more in donations as an MVP rather than giving their time & talent (an MVP that connects people to work on these for charities together)
- This product could eventually make money (even if through acquisition)


  

  

### Feature Set

- local discovery (maps + curation)
- charity education (trust + explainability)

## Design Principles

### **1. Trust over hype**

### **2. Local matters**

  


---

### **3. Calm, respectful UX**

  

Giving should feel:

- thoughtful
    
- unpressured
    
- human
    

  

We avoid:

- leaderboards
    
- guilt tactics
    
- public shaming or comparison

  

We design for:

- reflection
- continuity
- long-term use

---

### **4. Separation of incentives**


The product does **not** profit from donation amounts and does **not** touch donation funds.


This ensures:

- the app’s incentives are aligned with user trust
    
- donations remain donations, not revenue streams
    
- clarity about roles (tool vs charity)


Missing: things we can figure out later:
- revenue 




Research:
- desirability
- riskiest assumptions
- marketing strategies to acquire

*Starting this doc for initial research q's and important assumptions to validate.*
## Candidates
1. Warren Village
	1. Why?
		- Nick donates regularly to them is in some fancy tier 
		- They were an inspiration to the whole idea (Liz connection working wtih them)
    
## Questions for us to figure out
1. What is the feasibility of this product being a donation layer for charities?
	- This is critical.. If that element falls apart for any reason, we're reduced to focusing on discovery only, and then kicking them to the charity's site for donation. Which is good and all - it feels non-controversial and kind of shallow. And difficult for our product positioning because: 
		- We're reduced to kind of a yelp for charities (it could still be unique with location at least)
		- We lose any real incentive to having an account
		- We lose a part of the hypothesized value prop (one place to track giving, seamlessness there, sustainable budgeting and tooling)
			- Under the mission of activating this younger group that doesn't really donate today, could losing this cause us to miss a huge part of the friction we need to smooth out?


## Questions for them
- Do you work with 3rd parties today? 
- What is your mentality / attitude toward this setup, and benefits / concerns?
        - Knowing the giver’s relationship with the charity is important
        - Charity’s own attitude toward this concept (if negative, that becomes difficult)
        - What is charity’s attitude toward every.org? It’s similar?

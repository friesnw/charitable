1. What attributes of a location are required to display on the maps? 
	- Service base:
		- Draft policy: If the location does not directly serve the community within Denver, it shouldn't be included on the map.
		- Examples:
			- Not included: 
				- Admin-only building which is used by the non-profit's Denver staff for internal-only activities
				- Food Bank of the Rockies - Wyoming distribution center that does not cater to Denver
			- Included: 
				- Denver Rescue Mission's farm in the mountains used as a retreat for Denver residents
	- Permanence:
		- Locations that are relatively impermanent and likely to move don't need to be included on the map for now
			- Maybe just a data thing and could change in the future
		- Examples:
			- Food Bank of the Rockies have a TON of food pantries, often tied to churches or centers owned by other organizations which could change often
	- Ownership (???) 
		- If the location is TBD - sending an email


2. Are we sourcing content from the charity's site without permission?
	- Examples:
		- Text content like "mission"
		- Images like photos of their centers


3. What dictates whether a charity is displayed on the site? 
	- Examples:
		- Someone reaches out about having their charity included we saying we have to include every charity? art bloom parallel issue - more artist demand than consumer. how to maintain "quality"
	- Notes:
		- Is it bad to say we are deciding on a case-by-case basis? 

  


  
  

What level of info to include about a location?

- YES: A rehabilitation and adoption facility for abused and neglected horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules that have been removed from their owners by law enforcement authorities. The Harmony Equine Center also serves as a central hub where horses from humane societies and rescue groups can receive training and rehoming.

- NO: The 168-acre facility includes three sizable, well-equipped barns for intake, training, and adoptions, 26 pastures and turnouts, two indoor riding arenas, and an education center. Our knowledgeable, professional staff and dedicated volunteers provide safe shelter, nutritious feed, top-quality care, and training to the equines at the center.

  

Idea - maps isn't to share everything about everything. give enough info as a jumping off point, they can go to the website to learn more too.

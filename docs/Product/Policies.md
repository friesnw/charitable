- What does and doesn't qualify to be on the maps? What about admin building? is that relevant? 

- What does and doesn't qualify to be on the site? are we saying we have to include every charity? art bloom parallel issue - more artist demand than consumer. how to maintain "quality"

- Can we include photos that we have from websites? likely need permission? do we need permission from all charities in general?
  
- Food Bank of the Rockies situation - not showing all of the food pantries
  

- Do we include other locations? (e.g., foodbank wyoming distribution, farm for denver mission)

  
  

What level of info to include about a location?

- YES: A rehabilitation and adoption facility for abused and neglected horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules that have been removed from their owners by law enforcement authorities. The Harmony Equine Center also serves as a central hub where horses from humane societies and rescue groups can receive training and rehoming.

- NO: The 168-acre facility includes three sizable, well-equipped barns for intake, training, and adoptions, 26 pastures and turnouts, two indoor riding arenas, and an education center. Our knowledgeable, professional staff and dedicated volunteers provide safe shelter, nutritious feed, top-quality care, and training to the equines at the center.

  

Idea - maps isn't to share everything about everything. give enough info as a jumping off point, they can go to the website to learn more too.

## Revenue Model Exploration

### Problem
Revenue is explicitly deferred in the product positioning doc, but the "Separation of incentives" design principle (no cut of donations, no touching funds) constrains the available options. Listing candidate models now ensures the product isn't designed into a dead end.

### Tasks
- [ ] List candidate revenue models that are compatible with the "Separation of incentives" principle:
  - Premium features / pro tier for donors (e.g., advanced giving analytics, tax export tools)
  - Nonprofit SaaS fees (charities pay for enhanced profiles or visibility)
  - Sponsorships or local business partnerships
  - Data/insights licensing (aggregated, anonymized giving trends)
  - Grants or philanthropic funding for the platform itself
- [ ] For each candidate, note: alignment with trust positioning, feasibility at MVP scale, and risk of undermining user trust
- [ ] Identify which model(s) could be tested earliest with minimal engineering effort
- [ ] Add a "Revenue Candidates" section to Product-position.md (even if marked as post-MVP)

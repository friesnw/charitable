## Competitive Landscape Research

### Problem
The product positioning doc has no competitive landscape analysis. Without understanding how the target audience currently gives locally, it's hard to differentiate messaging, onboarding, and feature priorities.

### Tasks
- [x] Identify how target users currently donate locally (GoFundMe, church, direct to nonprofit websites, workplace giving, not at all)
- [x] Map existing platforms that overlap with Charitable's positioning (e.g., EveryAction, GiveGab, local community foundation portals)
- [x] For each competitor, document: what they do well, where they fall short for our audience, and what Charitable does differently
- [x] Identify which current behavior Charitable is displacing vs. creating net-new
- [ ] Add a "Competitive Landscape" section to Product-position.md summarizing findings

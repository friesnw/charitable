This file covers the research bases needed to check for available names. I plan to incorporate the business in Delaware.

Claude, here are the rules:
- Do NOT search domains or use aggregator tools (namechk, etc.) — they can trigger domain squatting
- Follow the below instructions for any inputted names within the prompt
- Create / update a file in `/docs/Research/Name-Research.md` with findings
- For social handles: focus on what's AVAILABLE, not what's taken
- For brand noise: don't assume similar names = "competitors" — refer to `/docs/Product/Product-position.md` to assess actual relationship
- Search both variations where applicable (e.g., "LocalGood" and "Local Good")

## **Federal trademark search (MOST IMPORTANT)**

### **USPTO – TESS (Trademark Search)**



This checks **nationwide trademark rights**.

  

🔗 **Trademark Search (TESS):**

https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/

  

Search the names listed initially, and any variations with spaces etc.

  

**How to search (quick method)**

- Choose **“Basic Word Mark Search (New User)”**
    
- Search exact phrase first
    
- Then search partial words (e.g., “Good” + “Nearby”)
    

  

**What you’re looking for**

- Status: **LIVE**
    
- Classes related to:
    
    - Software
        
    - Online platforms
        
    - Apps
        
    - Fundraising / donation services
        
    

  

If you see a **LIVE** mark in a related class → pause and evaluate.

## **2️⃣ Colorado business name search (operating state)**

  

This checks whether someone already registered a **business entity name** in Colorado.

  

🔗 **Colorado Secretary of State – Business Search:**

https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityCriteriaExt.do

  

Search the names listed initially.

This does **not** grant trademark rights — it just tells you if the name is already taken as a company in CO.

---

## **3️⃣ Delaware business name search (incorporation state)**

  

This checks whether you can legally form a company under that name in Delaware.

  

🔗 **Delaware Division of Corporations – Entity Search:**

https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx

  

Search the names listed initially.
  

Again: this is about **company registration**, not branding rights.

---

## **4️⃣ State trademark searches (secondary but useful)**

  

These catch edge cases where someone registered **only at the state level**.

  

### **Colorado trademark search**

  

🔗 https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/trademarks/main.html

  

### **Delaware trademark search**

  

🔗 https://corp.delaware.gov/trademark/

  

These rarely block SaaS products, but worth a scan.

SKIP 5, ignore this step and go to 6.

## **6️⃣ Social handle availability (brand consistency)**

**DO NOT use namechk or similar aggregator tools** — they can trigger domain squatting alerts.

Instead, manually check each platform:
- Instagram
- Twitter / X
- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- TikTok

**Try variants:**
- @[name]
- @[name]app
- @get[name]
- @[name]hq

**Focus on what's AVAILABLE, not what's taken.** Report available options with recommendations.

---

## **7️⃣ Google search / brand noise check**

This helps you understand **SEO + brand confusion risk**.

Search in Google:
- "[name] app"
- "[name] donations"
- "[name]"
- "[name] charities"

**You're checking:**
- Are there existing organizations using this name?
- What do they do? (Refer to Product-position.md to assess relationship)
- Is brand confusion likely?

**Important:** Don't assume similar names = competitors. Evaluate each org:
- What's their audience?
- What's their value proposition?
- Are they a platform like ours, or something else entirely (charity, marketplace, etc.)?

Report findings with **relationship to our product**, not just "competitor" labels.

## **8️⃣ App store name conflicts (future-proofing)**

Even if you're web-only now, check both app stores.

🔗 **Apple App Store:** https://www.apple.com/app-store/

🔗 **Google Play Store:** https://play.google.com/store

**Search BOTH variations:**
- With space: "Local Good"
- Without space: "LocalGood"

---

## **9️⃣ Optional but smart: domain history check**

  

Avoid domains with spam or bad SEO history.

  

🔗 **Wayback Machine:**

https://archive.org/web/

  

🔗 **WHOIS history:**

https://who.is/

---

## **🔟 If everything looks clean → next step (optional)**

  

Once you’ve chosen the name:

- You can later file a **federal trademark (Intent-to-Use)**
    
- That locks the name nationally while you build
    

  

(Not required immediately, but good to plan for.)

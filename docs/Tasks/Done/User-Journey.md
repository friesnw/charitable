## User Journey & Activation Model

### Problem
The product positioning doc describes what the product is but not how someone goes from "never heard of this" to "just made my first donation" to "regular recurring donor." The feature set (discovery, trust, ease, continuity) implies a funnel, but it's not explicit.

### Tasks
- [x] Define the acquisition entry point — how does a new user first encounter Charitable? (search, word of mouth, social, content)
- [x] Map the first-use experience — what does a user see and do in their first session?
- [x] Identify the activation moment — what action signals a user "gets it"? (first donation, first bookmark, browsing X charities)
- [x] Define what triggers repeat use — why does someone come back? (recurring donation reminders, new charity suggestions, giving history updates)
- [x] Outline the journey from one-time donor to recurring donor — what nudges or features support this progression?
- [ ] Add a "User Journey" section to Product-position.md with the mapped funnel

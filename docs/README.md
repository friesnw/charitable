### Task Management System
This repo uses a folder-based task tracking system. Each markdown file represents a single task or related group of tasks. Claude Code can read, update, and move these files as work progresses.

When creating files, they should always be .md

#### Folder structure:

Tasks/
- Todo/ - Draft tasks ready to be worked on
- InProgress/ - Currently being worked on
- Done/ - Finished tasks (archive)
- Backlog/ - Deferred tasks for later

#### Workflow:
- Todo moves to InProgress
- InProgress moves to Done or Backlog

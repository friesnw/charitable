# Charitable (brand name: GoodLocal)

Local-first charitable giving platform for Denver — discover trusted nonprofits and donate via Every.org.

I will frequently reference the /docs/tasks folder, with which we will manage our Todo tasks and want you to always update them as part of your workflow when we have new research and decisions.

## Tech Stack

- **Monorepo**: npm workspaces (`frontend/`, `backend/`)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Apollo Server (GraphQL), Express, PostgreSQL (`node-pg-migrate`), Zod for env validation, Resend (magic link emails)
- **Frontend**: React 18, React Router v7, Vite 7, Apollo Client, GraphQL Codegen, Tailwind v4, Mapbox (`react-map-gl`), Storybook 10 + Vitest 4
- **Payments**: Every.org embedded donation widget (modal); no custom payment processing
- **Auth**: Magic link email via Resend → JWT stored client-side in localStorage; no passwords; magic links expire in 15 min, JWTs in 15 days
- **Analytics**: Beacon (Deloitte) — first-party event tracking, stored in own PostgreSQL (not yet implemented; see backlog)
- **Deploy**: Render — backend as Web Service, frontend as Static Site (free), PostgreSQL as managed DB (free tier expires after 90 days)

## Architecture Decisions

- **GraphQL via Apollo** for all client-server communication
- **Express alongside Apollo** — needed for REST webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/every-org`) and analytics event endpoint (`/api/events`)
- **Every.org modal widget** for donations — no custom payment UI for MVP; Disbursements API is a future consideration
- **Magic link auth via Resend** — user enters email, receives link, JWT issued on verify; no passwords or bcrypt
- **JWT auth** stored in `localStorage`; `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on all GraphQL requests
- **PostgreSQL GIN index** on `cause_tags` array column for fast tag filtering
- **Mapbox** (`react-map-gl`) for charity discovery map — split-panel view with list and pin highlighting; 50K free map loads/month
- **Beacon (Deloitte)** for analytics — lightweight, first-party, no external dashboard; events stored in `analytics_events` table in own DB
- **No linter or formatter** — TypeScript strict mode is the primary guardrail; maintain stylistic consistency manually

## Conventions

- TypeScript everywhere (strict mode)
- ESM (`"type": "module"`) in both workspaces
- Environment variables validated with Zod (`backend/src/env.ts`)
- GraphQL schema-first; codegen generates frontend types (`npm run codegen`)
- Migrations via `node-pg-migrate` (sequential numbered files)
- `npm run dev` at root starts both frontend and backend concurrently
- DB columns are snake_case; converted to camelCase in resolver mapper functions (`toCharity`, `toLocation`, etc.) — never return raw DB rows from resolvers
- Every UI component in `components/ui/` has a paired `.stories.tsx` file — add one when creating new UI components

## Working Conventions (File Change Rules)

**New GraphQL field or type:**
1. Update `backend/src/schema/typeDefs.ts`
2. Add/update resolver in the relevant `backend/src/resolvers/*.ts` file
3. Run `npm run codegen` (backend must be running first)

**New page:**
1. Create file in `frontend/src/pages/`
2. Add route to `frontend/src/routes.tsx`
3. Wrap in `ProtectedRoute` if authentication is required

**New UI component:**
1. Create file in `frontend/src/components/ui/`
2. Add a paired `ComponentName.stories.tsx` file alongside it

**New database column or table:**
1. Create a new migration file at `backend/migrations/0XX_description.sql` — never edit existing migrations
2. Seed data belongs in migration files (see `005`, `007`, `011`), not separate scripts
3. Migrations apply automatically on server startup — no manual step needed locally or on Render

## Database Safety Rules

**NEVER suggest or run destructive database operations** (`DELETE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `UPDATE` without a `WHERE` clause) without:
1. First running a `SELECT` to verify what data exists and would be affected
2. Explicitly telling the user exactly what will be deleted and that it is permanent
3. Receiving clear confirmation from the user before proceeding

**Never assume a database is empty.** Always query first (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name`) before suggesting any destructive operation.

## Database

- **Local**: Uses individual `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` env vars
- **Production (Render)**: Uses `DATABASE_URL` connection string — auto-injected by Render, takes precedence over individual vars
- **Migrations**: Apply automatically on every server startup via `runMigrations()` in `db.ts`; safe to run repeatedly (no-op if nothing new)
- **Reference data**: 19 predefined cause tags live in `migration 010`; these are the only valid `cause_tags` values
- **Render free tier**: PostgreSQL expires after 90 days — upgrade before launch

## Render Deployment

- **Backend health check**: `/.well-known/apollo/server-health` — used by Render to verify the service is up
- **Frontend**: Static site with SPA rewrite rule (`/* → /index.html`) for React Router; `VITE_*` env vars are baked in at build time — a frontend redeploy is required if they change
- **Migrations on deploy**: The backend build command runs `migrate up` before starting — new migration files are applied automatically on every deploy
- **Mapbox token**: Restrict to production domain in Mapbox console after launch
